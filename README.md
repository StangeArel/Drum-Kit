# **🥁 Drum Kit**

This project is a simple drum machine.
When you press specific keys on your keyboard, a drum sound is played and the corresponding button is visually highlighted.

## 🎹 Used Keys
The following keys trigger drum sounds:
A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L

To find the corresponding data-key values, I used keycode.info.
